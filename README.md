## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MaryEllen and I am studying Data Science at BYU Provo! I love all things sports! I cheer for BYU, the 49ers, and the Sacramento Kings. I am learning more about hockey, but don't have a team yet.

The Kings are my all-time favorite, and I love watching all their games, especially when we win and light the beam! I have been to a few kings games, but have only ever seen them win at away games, so I have never experienced the beam in real life. My goal is to one day work in front office stats or player development stats for the Kings or really any NFL team.
